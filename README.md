# Platypus
Heavy reconnaissance robot simulator for search-and-rescue missions. Inspired by the real Portuguese robot RAPOSA and the vehicle physics of MudRunner. Mud. Stairs. Rubble piles. Slow, tense control. One wrong angle — and you're stuck forever. We're working to make every single stair climb feel like a small, hard-earned victory.
